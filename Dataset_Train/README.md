According to the theory of the kinesphere, the directions in which the human body can extend can be generalized. The first ones are the 6 one-dimensional directions: up, down, right, left, forward and backward. Then follow the two-dimensional directions that are formed by the union of two planes: right up, left up, right down, left down, forward up, forward down, back up, back down, diagonal right forward, diagonal left forward, diagonal right back and left diagonal behind. Finally, when using a third plane, 8 three-dimensional directions can be recognized: right forward up, left forward up, right back up, left back up, right forward down, left forward down, right back down, left back down.

The combinations that a person cannot perform without forcing their body (e.g., see the next image) to locate the most common directions are manually removed and they are left with a list with the following format.

We propose a arm movement dataset based on the theory of the kinesphere using Unity3D and different person models extracted from Mixamo. This dataset is on an external link, due to its very heavy weight.
